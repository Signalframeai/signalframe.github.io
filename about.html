        <h1>We Don’t Predict the Future — We Frame It</h1>
        <p>The world is changing faster than most people can comprehend. We’re surrounded by noise — economic instability, tech disruption, political chaos, climate volatility — and yet, the average person is left in the dark about what any of it actually means.</p>
        <p>SignalFrame is built to answer a simple but urgent question: <em>What am I supposed to do with this information?</em></p>
        <p>We're not here to forecast headlines. We're here to scan the weak signals — the kind of patterns and shifts most people don’t see until it’s too late — and translate them into moves you can make today.</p>
        <p>This project is led by someone who’s spent years fixing broken systems. I’ve worked in crisis, risk, and regulation — and now I’m building something that flips the playbook.</p>
        <p>We’re not VC-backed. We’re not selling hype. We’re giving people a way to out-think the chaos, one signal at a time.</p>
